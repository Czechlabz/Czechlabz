- 👋 Hi, I’m @Czechlabz AKA.Pinddulinka
- 👀 I’m interested in developing nyself as well as the society i exist and operate in..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to finally break lifes greatest barrier, learning to be satisfied.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reconstructing a deceased website formerly known as www.cannaseedcollective.ca, .com. www.mediseedcollective.eu . This repository of Cannabis genetics and knowledge was previously accessed through a vbulletin discussion forum. A not for profit medical and web initiative keeping a patients right to any treatment shown to have a positive effect on the quality of life being experienced, regardless of its present status. Illegal or otherwise.
My abilities at keeping the site functioning without snags was suddenly made impossible by a horribly toxic divorce, this having the result of being isolated as well as in no contact with my children for the past 10 years
As is said time heals any injury. I feel i have finally awoken and want to continue in good works.
The effort itself regards in essence a great deal of onlone forensics (the sites "heyday" taking place in the repression of the Bush jr. Republican presidency. Security measures as well as discretion as well as outright hiding, being at the time the norm.
Repression has been ceased, as well as outright legalizatoon in Canada. Which has led the legal (as well as taxed) Cannabis market, resulting in a multi-Billion dollar market. My years as Admin of this genetic repository, inspired me to further its cause regardless of the present atmosphere.
- 📫 How to reach me I can be contacted at. Philip.polivka@gmail.com, philipkidnap@gmail.com. .
